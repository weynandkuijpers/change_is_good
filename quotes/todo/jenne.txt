“Your heart knows the way.

Run in  that direction"

Dear Kristof!
Thank you for your brave immense heart, hearing it’s whispers,
letting it cry out saying This way!! Let’s go!
For following it fully, and inviting us for this wild, wonderful, divine ride!

“Only from the heart can you touch the sky.”

You’ve opened the heart wide, pointed up, and now
together we can say to the world, arms raised and dancing:

“Love calls - everywhere and always.
We're sky bound.
Are you coming?”

May the heart, the sky, the material and the divine support you,
in ways you can’t yet even imagine.

Jenne
(quotes by Rumi)
