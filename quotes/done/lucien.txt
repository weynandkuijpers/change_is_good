Dear Kristof \\
\\
The One that finds the truth, speaks about the truth, and stands his truth
and people will listen, learn and grow
your heart connects us all
your mind cuts out and carves 
and sculptured a platform for people to grow
from zero, from scratch
your healing is our healing, 
and as team we grow and evolve, connect and learn
core is trust and trust is core
that you continue to find in who you are, what you do and what the universe will bring
the dream that found your soul 
to expand us all 
\\
thank you dear Kristof to have become part of my life
and let us dream on, follow the waves that bring light, love and truth into all
and great Ibiza sunsets.} \\
