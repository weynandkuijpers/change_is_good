## Introduction

The purpose is to give a token of appreciation to our fearless leader - a token in which we try to provide back some of the love that he has been sharing with us over the last months / years.

This is the place where we will put together all the input / quotes for the token to Kristof.  If you want to contribute please put your contribution in a file in the quotes directory.

All is welcome - if you think of someone that is missing here - please tell him about this.

In the true spirit of being open and sharing - this is a living thing.  If for some reason we have mnissed out on people they can always add their controbution by creating a pull request.

New items can be added in two ways:
- add a file to the ./quotes/todo directory
- added a section at the bottom of the ./LaTeX/quotes2.tex file.

The LaTeX section should be something like:
```
\bigskip

\bigskip

\chapterprecishere{``<<insert your literal quote material between the double brackets>>''.
\\
\textup{<<INsert you personal note here>>}
\par\raggedleft--- \textup{<<insert your name here} }
```
